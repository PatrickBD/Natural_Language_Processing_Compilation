# ARPAbet-agrams
A new word "game" where words are found that share the same ARPAbet transcription codes, but with a different order!

We have all heard of anagrams, where you take a word or phrase and shuffle the letters to make a new one. However, I was wondering what if, instead of letters, what if we shuffled the words base sounds around. The ARPAbet is a set of phonetic transcription codes developed by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the 1970s. It allows us to break down words farther into visual representation of speech sounds. Now what if we shuffled these around to make, what I am calling, an ARPAbet-agram. This is a bit more complex than anyone would ever care to deal with (It makes anagrams look pretty easy by comparasion). Calling it a word "game" is somewhat generous, but we can make a computer do all that teadious work to find ARPAbetagrams and we can just enjoy the results. Feel free to play with this notebook or just download the outputed .CSV file of ~135,000 words and their possible ARPAbetagrams.
